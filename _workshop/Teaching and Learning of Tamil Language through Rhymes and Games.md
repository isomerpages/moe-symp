**Synopsis**

Play is an enjoyable activity that allows children to make meaning out of experience. Children are easily attracted to play. Integrating play in daily routines will establish quality interactions and this becomes purposeful play. Purposeful play enhances problem-solving and thinking skills among children. 

Nursery Rhymes are the most effective ways of rapidly developing a child’s vocabulary and grammar. Most nursery rhymes usually start off as short tunes which the child can easily sing and memorise. The rhymes come alive with the creative use of voice, eyes, facial expressions and body language. Through purposeful play, nursery rhymes can become action rhymes. Action rhymes have sing-song phrases and they involve movement.

The participants will learn how to integrate play and to establish quality interaction in the teaching of nursery rhymes in this sharing session.
