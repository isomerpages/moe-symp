**Synopsis**

Learning Tamil language through purposeful play using stories and practical activities support listening and speaking which later leads to reading and writing. Story telling also opens children’s eyes to other peoples’ thoughts and understanding. Language enrichment through day-to-day experiences connects stories to real life situations. 

The teacher takes the child on an imaginary journey through stories and activities. Parents can extend and continue this through practical and authentic situations. This is a tripartite partnership where the Teacher-Child-Parent are involved. Through purposeful play, the child is enriched abundantly without the stress of formal learning.
